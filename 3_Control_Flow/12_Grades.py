#Task
#Create a grades.py program that checks whether a grade is above or below 55.
#Start by creating a variable called grade and give it a value between 0-100.
#Write a if/else statement for the following:
#If grade is greater than or equal to 55, then print "You passed."
#Else, print "You failed."

grade = int(input('Grade: '))

if grade >= 55:
   print('You passed.')
else:
  print('You failed.')
