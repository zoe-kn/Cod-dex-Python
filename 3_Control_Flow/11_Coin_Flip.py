# Task: Before we dive deep into something called an if statement, let's do a fun demo using a coin flip simulation!
# Create a coin_flip.py program and type in the following:
# Note: We will learn more about random and .randint() later in the chapter.

# All you need to know is that this program simulates a coin toss:
# â‰ˆ 50% of the time, it's "Heads".
# â‰ˆ 50% of the time, it's "Tails".


import random 
num = random.randint(0,1) # Generates a random number that's either 0 or 1
if num > 0.5:
  print('Heads')
else: 
  print('Tails')
